      <p><strong>Explore my work in journalism and graphic design. </p></strong>

      <br>
      <p>My name is Erica Remboske. I am hoping to one day work in the arts & entertainment field as I love to write more with music
        reviews, concert reviews, and latest news that happens with celebrities. My lifelong dream is to become a writer for J-14, Seventeen
        or any other pop culture news outlet. I am also open to doing an internship that will help me gain experience before I jump right in. I am willing to learn
        anything and everyone even if it is not in my career field of choice. I am a hardworking individual and I love to express myself within my writing. As you look
        through my portfolio, I hope you see that this shines through my work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have written for multiple publications such as The Signal (the college paper), Next Wave Magazine, and Sweety High. I have learned more about editing and writing for 
          each audience. This creates diverse opportunities that I can take.</p>
